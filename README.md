# Hello-world
learn to use repository
hello, humans!
I'm learning how to use github to store and share my codes and I like C, C++, Java, and some machine learning tools like keras and tensorflow.
I'm very excited about others could commit thier ideas about my programs and so do I!
Try to code some beauty~
;-)
